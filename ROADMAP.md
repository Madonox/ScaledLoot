# List of planned updates
This is my personal list of updates that I'm planning to do in the future.

# Update 0.0.3 (planned)
- Add in an option to scale quota via generation, instead of when sold (this may upset some pre-existing saves, but can be used for mod compatibility, inspiration from https://github.com/Madonox/ScaledLoot/issues/2)
- Add in an exclusion list of scrap that players don't want included in the multiplier
# Update 0.0.4 (planned, **def not finalized**)
- Add a list for scrap that has a custom value multiplier
